# Conway's Game of Life in React

Welcome to the Conway's Game of Life project built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS. This classic cellular automaton simulation is implemented in a React application, with the help of Tailwind CSS for styling. The simulation is built with a grid of cells that evolve over time based on a set of rules. You can interact with the simulation by clicking on the cells to toggle them between alive and dead states. Use the controls provided to start, stop, and reset the simulation. Spacebar can also be used to start and stop the simulation.

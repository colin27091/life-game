# Conway's Game of Life in React

Welcome to the Conway's Game of Life project built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS. This classic cellular automaton simulation is implemented in a React application, with the help of Tailwind CSS for styling. The simulation is built with a grid of cells that evolve over time based on a set of rules. You can interact with the simulation by clicking on the cells to toggle them between alive and dead states. Use the controls provided to start, stop, and reset the simulation. Spacebar can also be used to start and stop the simulation.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

### Starting the Project

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the Conway's Game of Life simulation.

## How to Play

The Game of Life consists of a grid of cells that evolve over time based on a set of rules. You can interact with the simulation by clicking on the cells to toggle them between alive and dead states. Use spacebar to start, stop the simulation.

## Demonstration

A live demo of the project is available at [https://cregourd.github.io/life-game/](https://cregourd.github.io/life-game/).

## Troubleshooting

On Firefox, the simulation may run slower than on other browsers. This is due to the way Firefox handles the rendering of the grid. For the best experience, use Chrome or Safari.
